## TIME & SPACE COMPLEXITY.

### TIME COMPLEXITY - 

- It is used to measure efficiency of algorithm in terms of speed as the input size grows.

- Low Time Complexity  means High Speed.

- Time complexity tells how much time an algorithm takes to run as a function of input size (n).

- Common Time Complexities.

| Notation       | Meaning                                 | Example                     |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **O(1)**       | Constant time – independent of input    | Accessing an array element  |
| **O(log n)**   | Logarithmic – input is halved each step | Binary search               |
| **O(n)**       | Linear – grows with input size          | Looping through an array    |
| **O(n log n)** | Linear arithmetic – common in sorting        | Merge Sort, Quick Sort      |
| **O(n²)**      | Quadratic – nested loops                | Bubble Sort, Selection Sort |
| **O(2ⁿ)**      | Exponential – doubles every time        | Recursive Fibonacci         |
| **O(n!)**      | Factorial – all permutations            | Solving traveling salesman  |

### SPACE COMPLEXITY -

- Space complexity tells how much memory an algorithm uses relative to input size.

- Common Time Complexities.

| Notation  | Meaning                            |
| --------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **O(1)**  | Constant space – no growing memory |
| **O(n)**  | Linear – memory grows with input   |
| **O(n²)** | 2D arrays, matrix-based problems   |
