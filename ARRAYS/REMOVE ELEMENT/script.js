// Problem Statement:

// Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val.


// Consider the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val be k. To get accepted, you need to:

// Modify nums such that the first k elements contain elements not equal to val. The remaining elements beyond k do not matter. Return k.
